🚗 Car Defect Detection System Using Image Processing & Deep Learning

This project is an AI-powered system designed to detect external surface defects in cars from uploaded images. It uses image processing and machine learning techniques to identify scratches, dents, cracks, and other visual damages to assist in automotive inspection, insurance assessment, and repair workflows.
